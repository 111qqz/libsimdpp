Overview
--------

libsimdpp is a portable header-only zero-overhead C++ wrapper around
single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) intrinsics found in many compilers. The
library presents a single interface over several instruction sets. In addition
to that, the library allows to compile the same source code for different
instruction sets and seamlessly hook the implementations to an internal dynamic
dispatch mechanism.

The library resolves differences between instruction sets by implementing the
missing functionality as a combination of several intrinsics. Moreover, the
library supplies a lot of additional, commonly used functionality, such as
various variants of matrix transpositions, interleaving loads/stores, optimized
compile-time shuffling instructions, etc. Each of these are implemented in the
most efficient manner for the target instruction set.

The library sits somewhere in the middle between programming directly in
intrinsics and even higher-level SIMD libraries. As much control as possible
is given to the developer, so that it's possible to exactly predict what code
the compiler will generate.

Compiler and instruction set support
------------------------------------

  - This describes the current branch only which may be unstable or otherwise
  unfit for use. For available releases please see the
  [libsimdpp wiki](https://github.com/p12tic/libsimdpp/wiki).

The library supports SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, AVX, AVX2, FMA3, FMA4, XOP and
NEON instruction sets.

Code for ALTIVEC instruction set has been added, but it has not been tested
on actual hardware, thus definitely contains bugs.

The primary development of the library happens in C++11. A C++98-compatible
version of the library is provided on the
[cxx98](https://github.com/p12tic/libsimdpp/tree/cxx98) branch. Boost libraries
are used as a replacement for C++11-only functionality. The library does not
depend on boost if the built-in dispatcher functionality is not used. The
library has been tested with the following compilers:

 - C++11 version:
   - GCC: 4.8.1, 4.7.3
   - Clang: 3.3, 3.4

 - C++98 version
   - GCC: 4.8.1, 4.7.3
   - Clang: 3.3, 3.4

The C++98 version has been tested with boost 1.53 and 1.54. Most probably other
versions will work too.

Documentation
-------------

Online documentation is provided
[here](http://p12tic.github.io/libsimdpp/v2.0~beta1/doc/html).

Caveats
-------

Due to [bug #28831] (http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28831), GCC
produces non-optimal code for double precision floating point math on ARM.
Clang does not have this problem.
