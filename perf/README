This directory contains several programs for measuring the number of cycles
each implemented function takes. Not all functions are benchmarked.

Be aware that the results should be taken with a grain of salt. The tests are
very simple and many things that may affect their timing are not accounted for.
Generally, the results should be within 1/number_of_simd_execution_ports clocks
per instruction of the real value.
